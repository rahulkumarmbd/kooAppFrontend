## About Us
In the course of the fifth unit here at Masai School, we learned about React and Redux

At the end of our fifth unit, we were given a project as a part of our curriculum. We are assigned a website to clone as a construct week project. In this project we have to use all the skills we have learned till now. I had to clone [koo](https://www.kooapp.com/).

## About Koo

You will also find millions of others from all walks of life. Koo is home to the Voices of India. Follow people you like, know what's on their mind and share your thoughts with India too.
